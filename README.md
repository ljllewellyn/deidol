DeIdol
======

**DeIdol** is an extension for Firefox (currently) that replaces the banner image on the [PC Master Race subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace) with a modified, more community-centered banner image created by */u/mastermx*.

### How it works

The extension runs a simple page detection that, once on the PCMR subreddit, will execute a script that injects the following rules into the page:

`background: url('pcmr-banner.png') no-repeat scroll 0% 0% #000 !important;`

`background-size: cover !important;`

### Disclaimer

This is the first Firefox extension that I have ever tried to make. If it is rubbish, non-functional or otherwise lame then there's your reason. I'm truly sorry.
